# Network-Tools
A set of network tools for finding IPs and packet sniffing

-> Network Scanner tool will scan the entire network for connected devices and provides the information of their IP and MAC addresses.
-> ARP_spoof tool will try to spoof the ARP requests on router and target device. It lets our device act as Man in the middle between the target and gateway.
-> Packet sniffer allows us to sniff all the HTTP packets transmistted between the target and gateway. Through packet sniffer we can list down usernames and passwords entered by the target user.
